Operating Systems | Project 1 | AUEB, 2019

This is our implementation of 2019's Operating Systems Project at the Athens University of Economics and Business.
The objective of the project was to familiarize us with the language C and more specific with multithreading and mutexes, so as to comprehend better how operating systems handle resources and threads. It's a good demonstration of the POSIX pthread library as well as, programming in C. 
We implemented a theater booking system, where threads represent callers who are served by a fixed number of telephone operators through the process of booking seats.
The app was designed and tested in an Lubuntu 16.04 LTS VM.
